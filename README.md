### Predicting sales of a product
1. Identified null values and removed as there are only 2 rows with NaN values.
2. Visualised sales column data and checked for stationarity in data using adfuller-test from statsmodel library.
3. Made data staationary using differencing and implemented seasonal ARIMA to get good prediction.
4. Added additional 24 months data and predicted using SARIMA which performed well.
